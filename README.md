1) Run the command ```nmp install (npm i)``` in the terminal
 2) If you don't have the json-server package:
     ```npm install -g json-server```
 If you have this package, then the second step can be skipped.
 3) Run the command ```json-server --watch server.json```
 4) Run the ```npm start``` command
